                        This project is the one I am proudest of. My wife works at a level four school for children with severe behavior problems. Each time a student has an incident the teachers have to fill out an incident report. This information is then manually copied multiple times and stored in a Google Doc. The information entered was redundant, inaccurate and a significant drain on resources and time. I was able to create a program that streamlined their data entry process. Removing redundant data and replacing it with a secure database structure. This has increased data integrity and efficiency. Through this single app, I was able to save them hundreds of hours a month and help them with their difficult work. This project utilizes React, Node, and PostgreSQL." Here it should be "My wife works at a level four school for children with severe behavior problems. Also, change this - "Through this single app, I was able to save them hundreds of hours a month and help them with their difficult work.
