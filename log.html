                This project is the one I am proudest of. My wife works in a level
                four school for children with severe behavior problems. Each time
                a student has an incident the teachers have to fill out an
                incident report. This information is then manually coppied
                multiple times and stored in a Google Doc. The information entered
                was redundant inaccurate and a significant drain on resources and
                time. I was able to create a program that streamlined their data
                entry process. Removing redundant data and replacing it with a
                secure database structure. This has increased data integrity and
                efficiency. Through this single app I was able to save them
                hundreds of hours a month and help them with their difficult work.
