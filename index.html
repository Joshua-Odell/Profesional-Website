              <p> My wife is a Behavior Analysts who works at a school that teaches kids with severe behavior problems. <br>
                One struggle is communicating with parents to ensure that the same techniques are being applied at school and at home. <br>
                This app will allow parents to log behavior episodes to create an accurate timeline when paired with teacher information. <br>
                This will assist the diagnosis of behavior triggers and assist with meaningful progress. </p>
              <p> This app will consist of a phone based application as well as a detailed website for the acess of data. This requires full stack work </p>
