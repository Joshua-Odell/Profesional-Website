                <p> My wife is a Behavior Analysts who works at a school that teaches kids with severe behavior problems.
                  One struggle is communicating with parents to ensure that the same techniques are being applied at school and at home.
                  This app will allow parents to log behavior episodes to create an accurate timeline when paired with teacher information.
                  This will assist the diagnosis of behavior triggers and assist with meaningful progress. 
                  I am also working with the school district to create a program to give a single point of information input.
                  This will reduce the time spent duplicating information on reports. Thus, freeing up their time to work with the kids directly.
                 This app will consist of a phone based application as well as a detailed website for the access of data. This requires full stack work </p>

                <p> This program began as a simple tutorial for Python. Originally it was only a player vs. player project.
                  Once I heard that one of Bill Gates first projects was creating a tic tac toe game vs a computer 
                  I decided to test my skills to make a similar program. This project made me very comfurtable using conditionals 
                  and logic to produce a semingly independant actor. I got some tips from more experienced people online to reduce the complexity of the 
                  code. The end result is a program that is entierly capable of beating human players. The computer uses if logic to decide where to play rather then a simple 
                  random number. Though there is situations where it can act randomly.</p>
